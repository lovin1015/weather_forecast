## Changes as compared to your installed version:

### Changes

After the update to the actual version, you will need to open the integration options once and set the elevation of your collection.

- You now have the ability to set the elevation of your location.
- In addition to the forecast some calculations for the astronomical twilight and Moon setting, rising and phase are implemented. They indicate the darkness you can expect the upcoming night.
- Additional sensors:
  - *sensor.astroweather_elevation* - Elevation configured for this AstroWeather instance
  - *sensor.astroweather_sun_next_setting* - Next setting of the Sun, calculated for the astronomical twilight (-18Â°)
  - *sensor.astroweather_moon_next_rising* - Next rising of the Moon
  - *sensor.astroweather_moon_next_setting* - Nect setting of the Moon
  - *sensor.astroweather_moon_phase* - Current Moon phase in percentage
